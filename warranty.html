						<p>
						We offer a 1 year warranty on the repairs we perform. The warranty only applies to the parts we replace, other possible defects are not covered by the warranty. The warranty does not cover defects that occur due to external influences. The guarantee does not apply if the unit has been damaged!
						</p> <br/>
						<p>
						You as customers are obliged to use the device as soon as you have received it, and report a possible error within two days, if something is not as it should be.
						</p> <br/>
						<p>
						The warranty covers all the parts we use in our repairs. We of course follow the Craftsman Services Act.
						</p> <br/>
						<p>
						If we are unable to repair your device, you will not have to pay.
						</p> <br/>						
						<p>
						You do not pay if your device is not repaired. You only pay for the result. We do not charge for time and parts if we are unable to repair your device. Our price only applies to a successful repair.
						</p> <br/>
						<p>
						If unexpected errors occur during the repair that you do not want to pay to repair, you can choose to get your device back in the condition you handed it in to us, without paying!

						<h2>Important to note</h2>
						<p>
						<span>MobikoM</span> is an independent workshop, so it is important to note that if you choose to repair your unit with us, the <span class="bolded">manufacturer's warranty*</span> on your unit will lapse. If you still want to repair with us, we promise that your device will be as good as new.
						</p> <br/>
						<p>
						When a device falls to the ground,in the water, or gets run over by something, only the physical damage is visible. This does not mean that there isn't other damage inside of the device. For your device to work, all the components your device is made of must work. <span class="bolded">MobikoM</span> is not responsible for invisible damage.
						</p> <br/>
						<p>
						When you run in the rain and your unit is in your pocket / bag, when you take the unit to the bathroom while you shower, condensation can be formed which creates moisture damage to your unit. You will not notice these right away. Your device will work until it suddenly shots off or start acting uncommon. <span class="bolded">MobikoM</span> is not responsible for these damages.
						</p> <br/>
						<p>
						The customer is responsible for backing up their device. It is recommended to make a backup before returning the device for repair.
						</p> <br/>
						<p>
						Most people have password on their device, this stops us from checking if all the functions work properly. <span class="bolded">MobikoM</span> disclaims responsibility for defects in the device that we do not get tested.
						</p> <br/>
						<p>
						You as a customer will be contacted when your device is repaired, if you do not pick up the device within three months, it will become<span class="bolded">MobikoMs</span> property.
						</p> <br/>
